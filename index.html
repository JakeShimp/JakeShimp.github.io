    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Jacob! I am from Damascus Maryland. I went to Damascus High School. I really enjoy playing video games like Valorant, Pokemon GO, and R6 Siege, and really like ice skating. My brother played hockey for my Highschool, and he took me skating every weekend and I have grown to love it. I have a lot of animals; 2 dogs, 4 cats, 4 goats, a lizard, hermit crabs, etc. I have a girlfriend who goes to UMD, she is the most wonderful person in the world. And finally, my favourite color is black :D</p>
